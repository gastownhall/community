# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **Gas Town Hall Community** repository - the planning and organizational hub for the unofficial community supporting Steve Yegge's Gas Town multi-agent orchestrator project.

## Repository Structure

- `plans/` - Strategic planning documents (ecosystem plan, roadmaps)
- `images/` - Community branding and website assets
- `tmp/` - Scratch files (gitignored)

## Key Context

Gas Town Hall is a community-run initiative with these properties:
- **gastownhall.ai** - Primary website (docs, tutorials, eventually UI)
- **gastownhall.com** - Redirects to .ai
- **Discord server** - Community hub for real-time help
- **X (@gastownhall)** - News, tips, community showcase

The community serves users of Gas Town, which requires "Stage 6-7+" experience with AI coding agents. The ecosystem plan follows a "contributor-focused" approach based on Chris Sells' developer ecosystem framework.

## When Working Here

- Reference `plans/gastownhall-ecosystem-plan.md` for comprehensive project context
- The project uses Cloudflare Pages for hosting
- Future code will likely include: static site (docs), Discord bots, Q&A agent (RAG-based)
