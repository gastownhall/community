# Description

The Gas Town Refinery is a video podcast about Gas Town, an open source project
that lets you orchestrate unlimited AI coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI,
Google and more! In the Refinery, we stand in the ruins of tradition, manual
software development and talk about what comes next.
