## A Word of Warning

Gas Town requires **Stage 6-7+ experience** with AI coding agents. From Steve:

> Gas Town is an industrialized coding factory manned by superintelligent robot chimps, and when they feel like it, they can wreck your shit in an instant.

If you're not there yet, no worries - join the community, learn, and level up.
